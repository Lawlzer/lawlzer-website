## 📝 Learning Log

### Entry #1 - Cloudflare SSL Modes and Redirect Loops

**Tried**: Accessing staging.lawlzer.com with flexible SSL

**Result**: Infinite 308 redirect loop

**Learning**: "Flexible" SSL mode causes loops when origin redirects HTTP→HTTPS

**Applied**: Changed to "Full" SSL mode to maintain end-to-end HTTPS

### Entry #2 - Subdomain Middleware Recognition

**Tried**: staging.lawlzer.com without explicit subdomain config

**Result**: Middleware didn't know how to route it

**Learning**: All subdomains need explicit routing rules

**Applied**: Added staging subdomain pointing to /subdomains/root

## 📊 Progress
