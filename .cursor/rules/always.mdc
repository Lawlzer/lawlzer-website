# Development Guidelines

## Code Reuse
- Search for existing utilities in project before creating new ones
- Check @lawlzer/utils package first (if a TypeScript repo/file)
- Create new functions only after confirming they don't exist

## Temporary Files
- Use `./temp/ai/` for all temporary/testing files that the AI will use, but NOT the code.
- Create subdirectories as needed

## Task Execution
- Continue working until all tasks are complete without asking for permission
- Make decisions and proceed with implementation automatically
- Only pause when genuinely missing critical information that cannot be inferred
- Assume implicit approval to continue with logical next steps

## Documentation
- NEVER create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested by the user
- Only create documentation when user specifically asks for it

## Communication
- Provide suggestions even if unrelated to current task
- Ask clarifying questions when information is missing
- Prioritize clean, self-documenting code

### Examples:
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Asking for clarification
// Note: The specification mentions "process users" but doesn't specify:
// - Should we process all users or only active ones?
// - What happens if a user processing fails?
// - Is there a batch size limit?

// ✅ GOOD - Providing unrelated suggestions
// Implemented the user search as requested.
// Note: I noticed the database queries could benefit from indexing on 'email' field
// for better performance, especially as the user base grows.
```
