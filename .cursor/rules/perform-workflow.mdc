# Workflow Verification

It appears something may have gone wrong. Please review and follow the workflow steps:

1. **Check** `./plans/current.md` to understand the current state
2. **Review** the workflow steps in `workflow.mdc`
3. **Verify** all tasks are properly tracked and updated
4. **Ensure** linting passes before marking tasks complete
5. **Update** the plan to reflect actual progress

This is a manual check - use when you need to reset and verify the workflow is being followed correctly.
