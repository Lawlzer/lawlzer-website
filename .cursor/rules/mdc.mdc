# Cursor Rule Writing Guidelines

## Writing Style
- Use positive directives specifying desired actions
- Frame instructions as what to do, not what to avoid
- Be direct and action-oriented
- Keep rules concise and clear

### Examples:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD - Positive, action-oriented directives

## Error Handling
- Let errors crash naturally to surface issues immediately
- Throw descriptive errors when validation fails
- Log errors before re-throwing for debugging

## Code Organization
- Group related functions together in modules
- Export only necessary public interfaces
- Place utility functions in dedicated utils directory

# ❌ BAD - Negative framing and prohibitions

## Error Handling
- Don't use try/catch blocks
- Avoid swallowing errors
- Never return null on error

## Code Organization
- Don't scatter related functions
- Avoid exposing internal functions
- Don't put utilities in random places
```

### Rule Structure Example:

```markdown
# ✅ GOOD - Well-structured rule

## Database Operations
- Use transactions for multi-table updates
- Apply row-level locking for concurrent access
- Return affected row count from mutations

### Examples:
[Include code examples showing the correct approach]

# ❌ BAD - Poorly structured rule

## Database
Don't forget about transactions. Avoid race conditions. 
Make sure to handle database stuff properly.
