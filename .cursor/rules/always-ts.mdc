Do not implement try/catch error handling; If there is an error, simply throw an error and the code will stop executing.
Do not use .then or .catch syntax.

Use console.log for temporary logs. Use console.info for long-term logs, and use console.debug for in-case-of-emergency logs.

Use short-circuits, or short-returns whenever possible. if (!something) return; 

Do NOT use JSDoc, as this is TypeScript. There is no point in JSDoc and TypeScript.
Do not add comments unless it's absolutely necessary.
